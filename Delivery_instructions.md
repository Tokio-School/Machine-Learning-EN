# Instructions for the submission of assignments

To submit an assignment, please follow the steps below:

## Submissions

-	The exercises are structured according to modules and units (e.g., "M1U1 - Introduction to big data and ML")
-	Each unit has its own assignments to be submitted, usually incorporating a number of individual exercises.
-	Exercises will generally be Jupyter Notebooks, although they can also be in Markdown or other formats.
    - For Jupyter Notebooks, you must follow the instructions and fill in the cells indicated in each notebook, sending the same file (.ipynb).
    - For files in other formats, it will be clearly indicated what you have to submit and in which format.
-	Once you have completed all the assignment exercises, send them all together to the teacher via the assignment submission platform.
-	For said exercises, always use the following nomenclature.

## Programming style

-	Please try to follow the recommended canonical Python style in your exercises: PEP8.
-	As always, it is not a matter of following PEP8 entirely and to the letter (tabs vs. spaces, maximum line length, etc.), but of achieving a minimum level of code readability.
-	The easier it is to read your code, the sooner your questions will be answered, and your assignments corrected.

## Nomenclature
Always try to follow the indicated nomenclature to refer to the exercises, their sections or cells, in order for us to be able to clearly identify them when correcting the assignments or answering your questions:
-	The modules correspond to folders in the repository named "M00-Module_Title".
-	The sub-folders for each unit, representing a set of exercises to be submitted as a single assignment submission, are called "M0U0-Unit_Title".
-	The exercises in each submission are named "M0U0-0-Exercise_Title".
-	Within each exercise, each section is indicated as a 2nd level title.
-	Likewise, in each exercise, each code cell to be completed has a first heading line with a comment beginning with “TODO:".

Similarly, to refer to an exercise, section, or cell in a message to the teacher please:
-	Refer to the exercise by its full name, or at least by the module, unit and exercise number. E.g., M1U2-1.
-	Refer to the exercise section by its full title rather than by its number. E.g., "Creation of a synthetic dataset".
-	Refer to the cell(s) by its(their) title(s). e.g.,  “TODO: Generate a synthetic dataset manually, with bias term and error term initialised to 0".
-	If you prefer, you can always include a link to the exercise in the GitHub repository.

## Coding style
- Please try to follow the recommended canonical Python style in your exercises: [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- As always, it is not about following PEP8 completely and to the letter (tabs vs. spaces, maximum line length, etc.), but to achieve a minimum level of code readability.
- The easier your code is to read, the sooner your questions will be answered and your exercises corrected.

## Questions or issues

-	If you have any doubts, questions, or problems, do not hesitate to contact the teacher via private message on the platform.
-	The teacher will answer questions and correct the assignments as soon as is humanly possible.
-	If you have any questions about an exercise, don't hesitate to ask:
        - If you find any problem with the instructions, possible errors, aspects that are not well explained, etc., please let us know as soon as possible so that we can clarify it for you and fix the problem for the rest of the students.
        - Do not forget to clearly indicate which exercise or section you are referring to, following the nomenclature of the exercises or even with a link to the file in the public repository.
        - You can also attach the file in a private message on the platform with a question for the teacher, indicating the section you are having a problem with, what is happening, and what you have tried so far.

Finally, we reiterate, we are available on the platform and **the teacher will be happy to assist you with any question or problem :).**
