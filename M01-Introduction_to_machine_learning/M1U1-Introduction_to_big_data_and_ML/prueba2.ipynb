    "- Solving a series of linear algebra mathematical operations problems\n",

    "\n",
    "We will perform a series of linear algebra mathematical operations, to help us to fully internalise these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise you are asked to solve these exercises in the way you prefer: using a text editor capable of including mathematical formulas, LaTeX, a scanned document, or even a photograph of a sheet where the solution is clearly visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember to solve them manually, step by step. Of course, you can use any calculator to check the result, but we want to set out the features of the operation in order for you to understand it clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed these operations manually, this will ensure that you will not have any problems performing them using code in more complex implementations, such as the ones we will do during the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note from the teacher: Although it may not sound very sexy to do a high school maths exercise, being able to solve it without any problem and internalising these concepts will help you avoid many problems during the course and in your work, in my experience with ML :).*"
