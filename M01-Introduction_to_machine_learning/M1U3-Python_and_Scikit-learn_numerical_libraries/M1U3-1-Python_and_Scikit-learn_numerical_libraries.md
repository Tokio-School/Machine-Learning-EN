# **Python and Scikit-learn numerical libraries**

M1U3 - Exercise 1

**What are we going to do?**

- A brief overview of Python numerical libraries (NumPy and Matplotlib)
- Start working with the selected working environment
- Practice how to download, complete, and submit assignments

Remember to follow the instructions for the submission of assignments indicated in [Submission Instructions](https://github.com/Tokio-School/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Instrucciones%20entregas.md).

**Instructions**

In this exercise we will briefly review numerical libraries, you will explore and work with the chosen working environment and you will practice how to download and do exercises from GitHub.

**Working environment**

One of the objectives of this exercise is to familiarise yourself with your chosen working environment. Therefore, use the following exercises to make sure you master the JupyterLab working environment and interface, particularly for:

- How to download and import Jupyter Notebooks.
- How to work with code in Jupyter notebooks.
- How to restart Jupyter notebooks to reset our environment and variables, or clear cell results.
- How to download the files once they are ready to be submitted.

**Python numerical libraries**

_Why do we analyse and run these available tutorials online?_

For 2 main reasons:

- Because these tutorials are a fantastic way to discover the libraries, as good as any similar exercise we could prepare, very thorough and with a lot of additional material.
- Because this way you discover the tutorials and documentation available for each library. This way, if you have any problems during the course, you will know where to find the solution in the documentation, or additional content.

Tutorials:

1. NumPy (these examples simply analyse them on the web):
  - [QuickStart](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)
  - [The basics for beginners](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html)
  - [Fundamentals](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.html)
2. Matplotlib:
  - [List of available tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html): introduction, intermediate, advanced and more.
  - Download and run at least 2 and, as a tip, check at least 6 to get a good understanding of how Matplotlib works, which can be a bit complex at times.
  - At the bottom of the tutorial listing pages and at the bottom of each tutorial there is a link to download the Jupyter source code or notebook.
  - PS: If this is your first approach to Matplotlib, it makes sense to start with the 6 introductory tutorials. If you have used Matplotlib before, take this opportunity to review some more advanced case studies and discover something new.
3. Scikit-learn:
  - [List of available tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html) (very complete, you may find it very interesting to go through them during the course, as we explain some of these concepts).
  - Unique tutorial to analyse and run for this exercise: [Example of simple regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html)
  - Once again, at the bottom of the tutorial listing pages and at the bottom of each tutorial there is a link to download the source code or Jupyter notebook.

_Do you dare to modify any of them, e.g., by modifying their data or the settings of one or more cells or by adding more code? Experiment! ML and all related fields are resolved, and enjoyed, by experimenting :)_

Modify at least 3 notebooks in total, the ones that you prefer, and submit them with some type of modification.

**Exercise in the GitHub repository**

You should now prepare your working environment to download the exercises from the course exercise repository, which you will find on the platform:

- If you are using Google Colab, add the GitHub repository to your environment, browse for the file and save a copy to your Google Drive or another repository you own, before you start filling it out.
- If you are using any type of VM (local or not), Vertex AI Workbench, or another environment, download the file to fill it out.

**Deliverables**

You must submit the exercise from the GitHub repository [M1U3-2-Exercises\_libraries.ipynb](https://github.com/Tokio-School/Machine-Learning/blob/main/M01-Introducci%C3%B3n_al_Machine_Learning/M1U3-Librer%C3%ADas_num%C3%A9ricas_de_Python_y_Scikit-learn/M1U3-2-Ejercicios_librer%C3%ADas.ipynb) and the 3 files you downloaded and modified from the numerical libraries tutorials.
