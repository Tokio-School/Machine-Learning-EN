    "In this exercise you will not develop new code, but simply download and run 2 notebooks from the Scikit-learn documentation:\n",
    "- [Comparing different clustering algorithms on toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html)\n",

    "There are many conclusions we could add, e.g.:\n",
    "- No single clustering algorithm works well in all cases, with all possible data distributions.\n",
    "- Prior data analysis is even more critical when training clustering algorithms.\n",
    "- Pre-visualisation will help a lot, although it is quite difficult without dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "- The problem with clustering is that it is often inherently difficult to solve.\n",

    "Copy the code cells from the examples in the documentation, analyse the results, modify some parameters to experiment and test your intuition and answer the questions at the end of the exercise."
