    "## Task 1: Implement the cost function for multivariate linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you must implement the cost function for multivariate linear regression in Python using NumPy. The cost function must follow the function included in the slides and in the course manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, first fill in the code in the following cell to implement the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences between a vectorised and a non-vectorised implementation are as follows:\n",
    "- Vectorised uses linear algebra operations, from operations between vectors/matrices.\n",
    "- Non-vectorised is implemented with Python for control loops, iterating between sequences/lists of elements one at a time.\n",
    "- Vectorised uses Numpy, its ndarray arrays and operations such as np.matmul().\n",
    "- Non-vectorised is less efficient, as it does not use Numpy's numerical methods over C++ operations.\n",
    "- However, non-vectorised is much easier to understand at first, being pure Python, without relying on other functions and vector dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = h_\\Theta(X) = X \\times \\Theta^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J_\\theta = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i = 0}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^i) - y^i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement it, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Take some time to review the equation and make sure you understand all the mathematical operations reflected in it\n",
    "1. Go back to previous exercises or review the slides and write down on a sheet of paper (or auxiliary cell) the dimensions of each vector or matrix in the equation\n",
    "1. Write down the linear algebra operations step by step on this paper or in an auxiliary cell\n",
    "    1. Start by substituting $h_{\\theta}$ in the 2nd equation for its value from the 1st equation\n",
    "    1. The first operation is to find the $h_{\\theta}$ or Y predicted for each row of X (multiplying it by $\\Theta$)\n",
    "    1. 2nd, subtract the value of Y for this example/row of X, finding its residual\n",
    "    1. Then square the result\n",
    "    1. Then, sum all the squares of the residuals for all examples/rows of X\n",
    "    1. Finally, divide them by 2 * m\n",
    "1. Write down next to each step the dimensions that your result should have. Remember that the final result of the cost function is a scalar or number\n",
    "1. Finally, think about how to iterate with for loops for each value of X, Î˜, and Y, to implement the cost function:\n",
    "    1. Implement the formula using only for loops and the sum() function from the standard Python library, without using Numpy methods or operators.\n",
    "    1. Iterate over all the rows or examples of X (m rows)\n",
    "    1. Within that loop, iterate over the features or values of X and $\\Theta$ to calculate the predicted Y for that example\n",
    "    1. Once all the residuals have been found, find the total cost\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes:*\n",
    "- The steps mentioned above are only a guide, an assist. In each exercise, implement your code in your own way, with the approach you prefer, using the cell code scheme or not\n",
    "- Don't worry too much for now about whether it is working correctly or not, as we will check it in the next task. If there are any errors, you can return to this cell to correct your code."
